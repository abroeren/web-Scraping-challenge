                <p>Error message after error message. Mindnumbing and after more than 80 hours on all this this week, I just hope to avoid an "incomplete" submission and hopefully get the points for the jupyter notebook and whatever else is right, if anything.
                    Thank you for looking, checking, reading and grading.</p>
